#Pedicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction

This project is a part of my coursework in Intro to Machine Learning and Data mining.

This project's primary goal is to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or dissatisfied based on the information filled by them in the survey form.

I have uploaded the Rmd file and the knitted PDF file, which contains the entire R code and the output.

I have also uploaded the Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) to download and view the visualization.

I have created a Shiny Application to mimic the survey form and have deployed it on Heroku.

The view the files for the Heroku application, please visit the repository Passenger-Survey-Heroku or click here: https://github.com/smitpatil02/Passenger-Survey-Heroku.
